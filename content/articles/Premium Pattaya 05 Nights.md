title: Premium Pattaya 05 Nights
author: ThaiB2B
intro: "Pattaya is now touted as a centre for many of the large and sophisticated international hotel chains and you will definately find a fine selection of high class restaurants and the possibility of a more ''quite'' night life. Pattaya has also tried to crate an image not just as a youngsters destination but more as a family destination and a place for foreigners who would like to settle down for longer duration."
